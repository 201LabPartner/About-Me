    <h2>ðŸ’œEarly Life & EducationðŸ’œ</h2>
    <p>I grew up and went to school in Moore, OK. I started college while in high school and gained an academic scholarship to the University of Oklahoma to study English Literature. I loved the college atmosphere and learning! But life had other plans for me! I ended up eaving college early to get married and start a family. Not completing my degree was a disappointment for me for many years. But I enjoyed being a mom!</p>

    <h2>ðŸ’šCareer HistoryðŸ’š</h2>
    <p>Growing up, I always looked up to my grandpa. He had a farm, but he also owned several businesses in town. I admired how he was in control of his schedule and finances. I always knew I wanted to own my own company, but it took me a while to get there! Eventually, after the birth of my 4th child, I decided it was time to become my own boss! I started a cleaning company that immediately took off! Before I know it I had several employees and enough clients to keep us all busy! A few years later, I knew I wanted more. I had grown my business to the point I could step back and focus on other ventures. I settled on real estate and property management, specifically on the investment side. A few years of that, and I am ready for my next challenge! A realtor friend led me to Code Fellows, the rest is history! I am here and loving the journey so far! I cam't wait to see how my career path changes and progresses as I keep moving forward! </p>

    <h2>ðŸ§¡My GoalsðŸ§¡</h2>
    <p> My goals are usually focused on family, health and finances. After completing my courses at Code Fellows, my biggest goal is to find remote work as a successful dev! I love the idea of working from home, while contributing to a team! Goals along the way would be maintaining a work/life/school balance as a mom. Also, I am on a health journey to heal a few internal issues naturally and hopefully cut down my need for daily medications.
